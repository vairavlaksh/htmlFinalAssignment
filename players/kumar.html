            Bhuvneshwar Kumar Singh (born 5 February 1990) is an Indian international cricketer who plays all formats of the game. He plays for Uttar Pradesh in domestic cricket and for Sunrisers Hyderabad in the Indian Premier League. Kumar is a right-arm fast medium bowler who swings the ball both ways efficiently, with his inswingers more effective than outswing,[1] especially adept at creating late swing, and a useful lower order right-handed batsman.

            On his international debut, a T20I match against Pakistan in December 2012, in which he took a three-wicket haul and in the ODI series that followed, he made his One Day International debut. After his five-wicket haul against South Africa in the first T20I in February 2018, Kumar became the first Indian bowler to take a five-wicket haul in all formats of the game.[2]
