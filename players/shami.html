            Mohammed Shami Ahmed (born 3 September 1990) is an Indian international cricketer who plays for the Indian national cricket team. He is a right-arm fast and swing and seam bowler, who consistently bowls around the 140km/h (87 mph) mark, which makes him a deceptively potent fast bowler.[1][2] He is also known as a reverse swing specialist.[3] He made his ODI debut against Pakistan in January 2013 where he bowled a record four maiden overs. He picked a five-wicket haul on his Test debut against West Indies in November 2013.[4] On 23 January 2019 he became the fastest Indian bowler to take 100 ODI wickets.[5] On 22 June 2019, Shami took a hat-trick[6]against Afghanistan in world cup 2019 and India record's 50th World Cup win[7], and Shami became the fourth Indian cricketer to do so in One Day Cricket after Chetan Sharma, Kapil Dev and Kuldeep Yadav.
